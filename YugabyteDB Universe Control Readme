# YugabyteDB Universe Control Script
This Python script provides a command-line interface (CLI) to perform various control operations on your YugabyteDB universe managed by YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA), leveraging both gcloud CLI for VM control and yba-cli for universe management.

Usage

Important Notes & Troubleshooting

1. Description
This script automates common YugabyteDB universe operations, allowing you to:

Pause and resume all VMs in a universe in parallel.

Add new, manually pre-provisioned VMs to an existing universe and scale it up.

Run preflight checks on new nodes before adding them.

Decommission specific nodes from a universe and scale it down.

2. Features
Pause Universe: Stops all underlying Google Cloud VMs in parallel.

Resume Universe: Starts all underlying Google Cloud VMs in parallel.

Add Node(s): Prepares new, manually created VMs (runs agent provisioning script) and then scales the universe up to integrate these nodes.

Remove Node(s): Decommissions specified nodes from the universe and scales the universe down.

Precheck Node(s): Runs a preflight check script on target nodes to ensure readiness for YBA provisioning.

Centralized configuration via yba_config.yaml.

Detailed logging of operations.

3. Prerequisites
Python 3: Installed on the machine running the script.

pyyaml library: Install via pip: pip install pyyaml

Google Cloud CLI (gcloud):

Installed and configured locally.

Authenticated with appropriate permissions to manage Compute Engine instances (e.g., Compute Instance Admin (v1), Service Account User on VM's default service account).

YugabyteDB Anywhere CLI (yba-cli):

Installed locally and accessible via the path specified in yba_config.yaml.

YBA instance reachable from where the script is run.

YBA configured with the necessary Cloud Provider (GCP) credentials to manage instances in your project.

SSH Connectivity:

The ssh_user specified in yba_config.yaml must exist on all target VMs.

This ssh_user must have sudo privileges without a password prompt.

The SSH key for this ssh_user must be managed by gcloud (e.g., in ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine or via OS Login).

Pre-existing VMs for add-node: For the add-node operation, the VMs (with their IPs, zones, etc.) must be manually created in GCP before running the script. These VMs should:

Have the /data mount point ready.

Have the YugabyteDB binaries and scripts (including node-agent-provision.sh and preflight_check.sh) present at /data/2024.2.2.2-b2/scripts/.

Have the yugabyte user/group and its home directory already set up with proper permissions if using the "minimal setup" (which this script's add-node now uses).
